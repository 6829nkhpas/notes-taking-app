- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT + Google OAuth + Email OTP

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (mobile-first approach)
